# Multiple_Timeseries_store_item_forcasting

Developed an advanced time series forecasting system that predicts future sales for multiple store-item combinations using machine learning techniques. The project implemented and compared various forecasting models including ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, and LightGBM to identify optimal approaches for retail sales prediction. Key achievements include:

Engineered effective feature extraction methods for time series data, incorporating temporal patterns, seasonality, and holiday effects
Implemented robust evaluation framework using RMSE metrics to quantify model performance
Created visualizations to illustrate forecasting accuracy and comparative model performance
Applied optimization techniques to handle large-scale multiple time series prediction challenges
Delivered actionable sales forecasts that can support inventory management and business planning decisions

Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, LightGBM, Facebook Prophet, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks
